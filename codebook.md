activity (6): laying , sitting, standing, walking, walking downstairs, walking upstairs

tidy_data: contains mean values for each person and activity (180 entries) for the followig categories.

66 categories.

Mean and standard deviation (Std) values for accelerations (Acc) and gyrations (Gyro), measured by smartphones, and divided into directions (X,Y,Z), magnitude (Mag) and body, gravity and jerk accelerations/gyrations in time units (t) and Fourier transformed in frequency units (f).
